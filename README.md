# Ezproxy Switch Add-on for Firefox
To access academic papers on some sites, sometimes one is required to go through one's institute's ezproxy. Click the icon in the address bar to quickly switch between ezproxied URL and non-ezproxied URL.
## Usage
First fill in your institute's ezproxy address in Options. Then click the button in the address bar to quickly switch between ezproxied URL and non-ezproxied URL. The extension only transforms the URL. You will be connected to your institute's ezproxy server. If you are already logged in on your institute's network, then feast your eye on the paper you want to download. If you are not logged in, your institute will ask you to log in and you can feast afterwards. Credential with the institute is generally required to use its ezproxy.
